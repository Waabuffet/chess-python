# chess python

for gameplay, i had 3 options:
- make it a 2 player game on the same instance **(choice made)**
- make it a 2 player network game using a socket server with 2 instances, decided to implement it for another project **(personal growth)**
- make player2 an AI but i did not learn anything about machine learning yet, so will keep it as a future project
